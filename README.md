# firebase-db-crud-from-firebase-functions
Create a simple CRUD api for writing to the realtime database from firebase-functions

This project I created as a part of my home automation hobby. I use this code to allow my smartthings devices to report the status to firebase realtime database. Another UI project reads data from the realtime database and display as a dashboard.

## Install on Firebase
1. Clone the repository
1. Create your ```.firebaserc```
1. Push to firebase as a function
